# Advanced Todo Planner

A simple yet powerful Flutter-based to-do list app that helps you manage tasks efficiently.
Add, complete, and delete tasks easily, with intuitive UI and smooth interactions.

🔍 **Status**: Archived as of June 2025 — this project served as a personal practice app to explore Flutter, Dart, state management, and local persistence using Hive.
